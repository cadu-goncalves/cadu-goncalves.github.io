I keep most of my personal projects on my "corporate" profile, related with an [website](http://www.etriphany.com) I own, so i can let my "personal" profile to fork projects to learn from or experiment without coding myself.

Most relevant projects are:


### [Lucene Showcase](https://github.com/etriphany/lucene-showcase) 
Part of my showcase projects this one is dedicated to show features from **Apache Lucene**.

***

### [Docker Elasticsearch](https://github.com/etriphany/docker-elasticsearch)
Part of my Docker projects I use to learn about... Docker of course.


***
### [UserManagement Microservice] (https://github.com/cadu-goncalves/user-mng)
Single microservice project based on Java 8 and Spring Boot, has built-in CI/CD integration based on CircleCI and Docker Hub.

## Upcoming Projects

### Microsevice Showcase

  I'm working on this showcase project, basically implementing a set of Microservices that will also include DevOps integrations (some extension of my **UserManagement Microservice** project).

  This is an IOT project that should include both hardware and software sources for a aquarium monitor system easy to use.
